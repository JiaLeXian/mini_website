    <h2>Chrysanthemums</h2>
    <p>Chrysanthemums (/krɪˈsænθəməm/), sometimes called mumingtons or chrysanths,[4] are flowering plants of the genus Chrysanthemum in the family Asteraceae. They are native to East Asia and northeastern Europe. Most species originate from East Asia and the center of diversity is in China.[5] Countless horticultural varieties and cultivars exist.
    </p>
    <p>Chrysanthemums (Chinese: 菊花; pinyin: Júhuā) were first cultivated in China as a flowering herb as far back as the 15th century BC.[10] Over 500 cultivars had been recorded by 1630.[8] By 2014 it was estimated that there were over 20,000 cultivars in the world and about 7,000 cultivars in China.[11] The plant is renowned as one of the Four Gentlemen (四君子) in Chinese and East Asian Art. The plant is particularly significant during the Double Ninth Festival.</p>
